MikroORM:

the entities correlate the tables in your postgreSQL database

VS Code setup (plugins):

bracket pair colorizer 2
Docker
GraphQl for VSCode
Prettier

random in case you didn't know ...
ctrl + space for autocomplete in vscode
ctrl + period when cursor at the end of some code block to autoimport
